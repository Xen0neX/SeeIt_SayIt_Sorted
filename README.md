# See It, Say It, Sorted

This is a simple project demonstrating my understanding for various sorting algorithms.
There are simple unit tests added to test the code for these algorithms.

I plan to add visual representations for these algorithms in the future.

The idea's for sorting algorithms was taken from:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/#algo

The following books were used as a reference for the concepts discussed:
- Algorithms (4th edition) by Robert Sedgewick
- Introduction to Algorithms (3rd edition)
- Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos

This project is for educational purposes only.
